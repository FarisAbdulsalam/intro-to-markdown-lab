# Building a Sandwich

A Sandwich is a magnificent food, eaten throughout the world, and the perfect sandwich is all about choosing the right ingredients for the job

## Components of a Sandwich

### Bread

Let's start with the bread. There's a boatload of varieties of bread to choose from, we'll cover a few here. 

* __Sourdough__: A chewy bread. A certified classic, it's perfect for all types of sandwiches.
* __Whole Wheat__: A wholesome loaf for a wholesome sandwich.
* __White bread__: Great for deli meat sandwiches.
* __Ciabatta__: Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.

Do __NOT__ forget to toast the bread. Toasted bread is crucial for a great sandwich!

### Sauce

A great sandwich needs a great sauce to go with it. This part is very personal, so go nuts. _Mayonnaise_ is a great general condiment to use on sandwiches, it goes with basically anything. Same with _mustard_. Feel free to experiment and find your perfect condiment!

### Meat (or lack thereof)

Plenty of things to consider in this section. Smoked meats, steak, shredded chicken, and much more. You name it, it can go on a sandwich. Pick your preferred meat and layer it on there! Careful not to add too much though, balance is key.

### Veggies

Veggies add a layer of freshness to the sandwich. Crunchy veggies like cucumbers add a much needed crunch to a sandwich. Balance out the crunch with freshness from leafy vegetables like lettuce and juiciness from tomatoes or pickles. Go crazy, it's your sandwich.

### Cheese

Mmmm yummy cheese. A sandwich is incomplete without cheese, if you ask me. Use American cheese, Cheddar, Mozzarella, up to you, they all work great

## Ok, I got all my ingredients. Now what?

Now, you __assemble__ the sandwich.

### ok, but how?

1. Grab that bread and open that bad boy up.
2. Toast it.
3. Spread your chosen condiment(s) on both sides of the bread.
4. Start with the __leafy greens__ if you're putting them on your sandwich. They hold everything together!
5. Next up, the cheese.
6. Layer on your meats of choice.
7. Time for the crunchy veggies. This is where your cucumber & co. go.
8. Layer on the juicy veggies like tomatoes.
9. Close that sandwich, cut in half, and dig in.
>TIP: If you're using tomatoes, salt them. Trust me.

## Woohoo

Congrats, you have made and devoured your very own sandwich.
